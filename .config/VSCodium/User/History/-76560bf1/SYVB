# These values are used by the roetz-mock-server, it defines the network interface the mock server runs on.
# IMPORTANT: use 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost for local development! Within node, by default localhost resolves to the ipv6 loopback address, which is ::1
# Source: https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/47785
# To test this out, run the following command within the roetz-mock-server directory to find out where localhost resolves to:
# node -e 'dns.lookup("localhost", console.log)'
